#Diversify
**Diversify** is a web portal to your Guild Wars 2 commerce and investments. Given your official API key, it will:

* Show a history of items that you've purchased and sold
* Follow any purchases that you tag as investments
* Watch the price of bookmarked items
* Summarize the performance of your past investments
* Link items in your portfolio to track them in tandem

##Why Diversify?
Investing is as simple as buying an item now and selling it later for profit. Multiple items can be invested in simultaneously, both to help reduce risk and to profit from different market movements. This set of items that you've invested in is called your *portfolio*.

As more items become part of your portfolio, they will inevitably become harder to keep track of. Perhaps you purchased several of the same item at different times, so calculating profit isn't simply multiplying the number you bought by the current price. On the other hand, maybe you just sold a portion of your holdings in one item, but later want to calculate total profit after all of it sells.

This previously simple arithmetic quickly becomes cumbersome to keep up with, and even more so when it comes to thinking of transaction fees or using items in crafting recipes.

##Cost Adjustments
While much of what Diversify does is automatic, it also allows for *manual cost adjustments*. Adjustments can be positive or negative, and can be used when the value of your investments are impacted outside of the trading post.

One situation where this comes in handy is when you need to take into account extra or missing quantities of items marked as investments. For example, you've invested in 100 Silk Scraps and NPC them instead of selling them on the trading post. With a manual cost adjustment, this transaction can be linked to the appropriate portfolio item.

In the cases where crafting is used to add value to an investment, the sale transaction can later be added to the appropriate portfolio item to be automatically tracked. However, if additional item costs or savings are involved, they must be accounted for with a manual cost adjustment. This will be the case when you need to buy items from NPCs to complete the crafting, or when you already have some of the materials and want to consider their expenditure in your profit.

Manual cost adjustments can also come in handy when only a subset of a transaction is investment-related. For instance, you may want to purchase 125 Mithril Ingots to craft with and an additional 125 as an investment. It wouldn't make sense to split the purchase into two transactions, so a cost adjustment can be used to smooth out the accounting.
