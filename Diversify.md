#Diversify
Diversify is a mobile portal to your Guild Wars 2 commerce and investments. Given an official API key, it can:
* Show a history of items that you've purchased and sold
* Track any purchases that you tag as investments
* Watch the price of bookmarked items
* Summarize the performance of your past investments
* Automatically link portfolio items that are related by recipes

##Investment and You
Investment can be as simple as putting some of your extra gold into an item. Generally, this is followed by selling the item when it reaches a point at which you profit.

As more items become part of your portfolio, they will inevitably become harder to keep track of. This applies even more so when thinking of upfront costs, transaction taxes, and become tied up through crafting or mystic forge recipes.
